	1. Either fill in the **name of the income** or select the **client** from which you have received this money. You can fill both too but at least one of them is required.

		> **Pro Tip:** Client will be prominent in this case, click on **Add New** for new client. **Name of income** is optional.

	2. Select the **mode** of income & provide a suitable **reference number**.

		> **Pro Tip:** For example, if you received this money through cheque, you might want to record Cheque Number as reference number. Or for receiveing money through PayPal, Transaction ID becomes a good candidate for reference number.

	3. **Currency** will be ineditable as it will be same as of invoice's but **exchange rate** can be edited depending upon the present value.

	4. Mention the **date** on which the income is received and the **total amount** of the income.

	5. Select the **category** of income.

		> **Pro Tip:** Make more categories if required, as you can generate report of incomes grouped by these categories.

	6. Select the **account** in which you received this money. You can think of this account as your bank accounts or the "Cash In Hand".
	
		> **Pro Tip:** Make more accounts if required, as you can generate report of incomes grouped by these accounts.	

	7. You can write the **note**, which is any piece of information you wish to associate with this income.

		> **Pro Tip:** Write anything that you want to remember for this income.

4. Click on **Save** to add the income.

	> **Pro Tip:** Now onwards, this income is visible in the list in **Transactions** >> **Incomes** section.
