3. Select the **Client** from the left side drop-down and click on **Generate** to view report.

4. Add the **From** & **To** date in next two blanks to filter the result between a time frame.

	> **Pro Tip:** From and To, by default, are first and recent transaction date respectively for a client , so if both would be blank then report would include all transactions till recent transaction date. You can put limits on dates simply by mentioning values.
